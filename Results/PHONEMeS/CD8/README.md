# PHONEMeS Results - CD8
Here we store PHONEMeS results for the CD8 cells. Results are organized as following:
 
## CPLEX results
 
These are the networks generated by the [PHONEMeS analysis](https://github.com/saezlab/Prostaglandin_Project/tree/master/PHONEMeS Analysis/CD8). They are stored as `cplex_grouped_1.txt`, `cplex_grouped_2.txt`, `cplex_grouped_3.txt`, `cplex_grouped_4.txt`, `cplex_grouped_5.txt`, `cplex_grouped_combined.txt` table files for each case as described in the [analysis documentation](https://github.com/saezlab/Prostaglandin_Project/blob/master/PHONEMeS-Analysis/CD8/README.md). These tables contain the source and the target of each interaction (1st and 3rd columns) and it also contains the weight of the interaction (2nd column), showig how often an interaction appeears among the alternative optimal solutions generated by PHONEMeS.
 
## Nodes attributes
 
These are the attributes assigned to each of the nodes in the PHONEMeS networks (whether a node is a target/EP receptor, a measurement or an intermediate inferred node). The `attributes_grouped_cplex_1.txt`, `attributes_grouped_cplex_2.txt`, `attributes_grouped_cplex_3.txt`, `attributes_grouped_cplex_4.txt`, `attributes_grouped_cplex_5.txt`, and `attributes_grouped_cplex_combined.txt` correspond to the node attributes assigned to each of the PHONEMeS solutions described above.

## Visualization style

The `PHONEMeS_vizmap.props` represents the costumized cytoscape style of PHONEMeS for better visalization of the networks.

## Cytoscape

CD8 network solutions are stored in `CD8 PHONEMeS Networks.cys` for a better visualization.
